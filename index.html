            Cake is a symbol of celebration. Because it has a rich, sweet flavor and is associated with special 
            occasions and milestones, eating cake is a ritual that reminds us to savor the moment. 
            Cake is typically served where people gather to celebrate and share in the joy of the occasion. Cake is a 
            sensory experience for the tastebuds of course, and it's also an aesthetically expressive outlet! 
            With a few tools and some imagination, you can make your own curated work of edible art for 
            your next celebratory event- or just to celebrate your own artistry! 
            </p>

            A simple, crowd-pleasing vanilla cake with buttercream frosting is a great place to start
            your cake decorating journey- it's a blank canvas! Browned butter adds dimension to a classic vanilla cake,
            and American buttercream, while much sweeter and richer than European buttercream varieties,
            is the perfect medium to create texture using <a href=https://www.wilton.com/learn-piping-techniques/ target="_blank"> piping techniques.</a> American
            buttercream is also fairly stable (with a low water content) so it holds colorings well- everything from delicate pastels 
            to saturated neons. Gel food coloring, <a href=https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/s/offset-spatula/ target="_blank"> an offset spatula</a>, <a href=https://www.webstaurantstore.com/ateco-334-8-piece-stainless-steel-piping-tip-decorating-set-august-thomsen/144334.html?utm_source target="_blank"> piping bags & tips</a>, and a <a href="https://www.atecousa.com/decorating-turntables.html" target="_blank"> turntable</a>
            are the basic physical tools worth the investment to realize your decorating dreams.

            While baking your cake, whip up the buttercream recipe. Let your cakes cool <i>completely</i>, and/or chill
            before building a layered cake to frost. After cakes are cool and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hNxFPiW2OM" target="_blank"> leveled</a>
            spread an even layer of buttercream on the bottom round. Place your other round on top, and use an offset spatula to cover the cake in a thin layer of buttercream. Chill for 20 minutes,
            and you're ready to go!

         <h4>Buttercream Method</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>Beat butter on medium speed for 1-2 minutes until smooth and glossy using the paddle attachment on a stand mixer.</li>
            <li>Mix vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste and salt on low speed.</li>
            <li>Slowly add powdered sugar while mixing on the lowest setting. Halfway through add in heavy cream.</li>
            <li>Mix on low until the ingredients are fully incorporated and the desired consistency is reached. </li>
            <li>If the frosting is too thick, add in additional cream, slowly. If the frosting is too thin, add in more powdered sugar, slowly. It should be the consistency of mayo!</li>
            <li>If you plan to color the buttercream, add in the gel food coloring once the frosting is fully mixed and beat on low until it reaches the desired color.</li>
            <li>To make the frosting extra smooth, stir it by hand with a rubber spatula for a minute or two right before you use it.</li>
         </ol>
